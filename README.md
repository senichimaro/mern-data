# MERN kata
This kata setup MERN stack.

Starts by building the Back-End. Uses Express like a NodeJs interface to setup easily and quickly a Web Server. The Key about this Server is their routes and controllers.

The routes are the endpoints where front-end data will be targeted. And controllers are the handlers the logic inside the endpoints.

### Back-End

Back-End data will be provided by the MongoDB database engine from a local development context. Uses Mongoose like a MongoDB interface to setup easily and quickly a Model Schema to operate with, even to create, read, update and delete data from MongoDB no-relational database.

Exist many more features that makes a MERN stack posible, like cors for this example. This MERN stack is separate in two ports into the same domain, one for react (3000) and other for express (3001).

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy, or CORS, protect from malicious redirections, actions from one domain to be executed in another different domain, and other kind of practices around potentially malicious attacks.

CORS policy prohibit some legitimate actions by their potential to be malicious. This is the our case. For those security reasons, cors policy will block the calls from 3000:front-end to 3001:back-end. The reason is because cors resource sharing policy said that this sharing have to be within the same origin, meaning it have to be within the same port.

Cors package will allow as to set a trusty front-end origin which will be allowed to call at the back-end requesting their data.


### Front-End
Front-End main task is to provide user interface. Their logic request for data to the back-end endpoints and waits for the data within the response.

The request logic is built by two abstraction layers. At the base level there is the component logic. It receives the data from the component, gives it to the logic that request at the back-end and waits for a response for render this data.

The second layer is in the middle of the back-end and the components, deals with back-end requesting to the endpoints and receives the response from them, this response its derived to the front-end to rendered for the user.
